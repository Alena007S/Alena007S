## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Alena a Junior QA engineer.

I completed the "QA Engineer" course at Hexlet online programming school. During the course, I learned the basics of QA, like testing theory, functional, non-functional and regression testing. I got acquainted with DevTools, GitHub, SQL, HTTP and Postman. I learned test design techniques, and also wrote test cases and bug reports for educational projects.

I would like to be a part of the company where I can grow professionally and have an impact on the companyâ€™s development. I will be happy to use the knowledge in practice and learn new things.
